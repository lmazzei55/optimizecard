# Profile Settings Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Page Reload on "Save Preferences" ❌ → ✅**

**Problem:** The profile page was reloading when users clicked "Save Preferences"

**Root Cause:** The `await update()` from NextAuth was causing page refreshes

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the `handleSave` function to use NextAuth's `update()` method properly
- Added localStorage signaling for cross-component communication
- Improved session state management to prevent unnecessary reloads

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Enhanced save function with better session handling

### 2. **Missing Premium Upgrade Prompts ❌ → ✅**

**Problem:** Profile settings allowed clicking on premium features (Points, Best Overall) without showing upgrade prompts

**Root Cause:** Profile page lacked subscription tier checks and upgrade prompt logic

**Solution:**
- Added subscription tier state management to profile page
- Implemented `handleRewardPreferenceChange` function with premium feature checks
- Added upgrade prompt modal with feature-specific messaging
- Added "PRO" badges to premium options for free tier users

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Added subscription checks and upgrade prompts
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Added `subscriptionTier` to session interface

### 3. **Tab Switching Resets Preferences ❌ → ✅**

**Problem:** When users switched tabs and returned, their preference selections would reset to cashback

**Root Cause:** Session state management conflicts and lack of localStorage persistence

**Solution:**
- Enhanced session loading logic with localStorage backup
- Added preference persistence across tab switches
- Improved hydration handling to prevent conflicts
- Added localStorage saving for all preference changes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/SpendingForm.tsx` - Enhanced session state management with localStorage backup
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Improved preference persistence

### 4. **Terms & Privacy Pages Not Accessible ❌ → ✅**

**Problem:** Terms and Privacy pages existed but weren't easily accessible to users

**Root Cause:** No footer or navigation links to legal pages

**Solution:**
- Created a comprehensive Footer component with legal page links
- Added footer to main layout for site-wide accessibility
- Included affiliate disclosure in footer for transparency

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/Footer.tsx` - New footer component with legal links

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added Footer component to main layout
