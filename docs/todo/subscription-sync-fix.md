# Subscription Sync Fix – To-Do List

## Issue Identification
- [x] Document the specific problem with evidence from user logs
- [ ] Reproduce the issue in development environment
- [ ] Identify all affected user flows and components

**Evidence**: User logs show `✅ UserState: Subscription tier loaded: free` despite successful payment.

## Root Cause Analysis
- [x] Trace the subscription tier loading flow in UserState
- [x] Examine Stripe webhook handling for subscription updates
- [x] Check database sync between Stripe and local user records
- [x] Analyze API endpoints for subscription status retrieval
- [ ] Review authentication flow and session management

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: The issue is a **503 Database Unavailable** error during subscription loading, combined with insufficient fallback mechanisms for premium users. The user paid successfully, but:

1. **503 errors** prevent subscription API from working properly
2. **No cached premium status** - user gets downgraded to 'free' when database is unavailable
3. **Auto-upgrade logic exists** but isn't triggered due to 503 errors
4. **Webhook may not have fired** or failed due to database issues

## Code Flow Investigation
- [ ] Map out the complete auth → payment → subscription sync flow
- [ ] Identify all points where subscription tier is set/updated
- [ ] Check for race conditions or timing issues
- [ ] Examine error handling in subscription sync processes

## Solution Design
- [x] Document root cause with specific code references
- [x] Design fix with minimal impact to existing functionality
- [ ] Plan database migrations if needed
- [x] Design comprehensive testing strategy

**SOLUTION DESIGN**:

The fix involves enhancing the fallback mechanism in `/api/user/subscription` to still attempt Stripe verification even when the database is unavailable:

1. **Enhanced Fallback Logic**: When database fails with 503, still try to verify with Stripe using email lookup
2. **Stripe-First Verification**: If database is down, fall back to Stripe as source of truth
3. **Better Caching**: Cache premium status in localStorage with longer expiration for resilience
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Distinguish between different types of failures and respond accordingly

**Key Changes Needed**:
- `src/app/api/user/subscription/route.ts`: Add Stripe verification in database fallback scenario
- `src/lib/user-state.ts`: Enhance localStorage caching for premium status
- Add retry logic for critical subscription checks

## Implementation
- [x] Implement subscription sync fixes
- [x] Add proper error handling and logging
- [x] Ensure idempotent operations for webhook processing
- [x] Add fallback mechanisms for failed syncs

**IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**:

1. **Enhanced `/api/user/subscription` Fallback** (lines 144-186):
   - Added Stripe verification when database is unavailable (503 errors)
   - Returns premium status from Stripe even when database is down
   - Maintains existing auto-upgrade logic for normal operation

2. **Improved UserState Caching** (lines 255-295):
   - Enhanced premium status caching with 4-hour validity
   - Email-specific cache validation to prevent cross-user contamination
   - Automatic cache expiration and cleanup

3. **Better Error Handling** (lines 162-210):
   - Distinguishes between different failure types (503, 401, network)
   - Uses cached premium status as fallback during any API failure
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging subscription issues

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test successful payment → tier upgrade flow
- [ ] Test webhook delivery and processing
- [ ] Test edge cases (duplicate webhooks, delayed webhooks)
- [ ] Test user experience during sync delays
- [ ] Validate database consistency
- [ ] Test with multiple user scenarios

## Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md with fix details
- [ ] Document the subscription sync architecture
- [ ] Create or update rules for subscription handling patterns
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting recommendations

## Test Scenarios to Validate
1. **Happy Path**: User pays → webhook received → tier updated → UI reflects premium
2. **Delayed Webhook**: User pays → UI shows loading → webhook arrives → tier updates
3. **Failed Webhook**: User pays → webhook fails → manual sync works
4. **Duplicate Webhooks**: Multiple webhooks don't cause issues
5. **Session Persistence**: Tier persists across page refreshes/logins

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User tier correctly shows "premium" after successful payment
- [ ] Subscription status persists across sessions
- [ ] Webhook processing is reliable and idempotent
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] No regression in existing auth/subscription functionality
