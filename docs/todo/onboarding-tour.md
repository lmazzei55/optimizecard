# Onboarding Tour â€“ To-Do List

## Planning & Research
- [ ] Review existing code structure and identify integration points
- [ ] Research best practices for onboarding tours (react-joyride, intro.js, etc.)
- [ ] Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md with planned onboarding tour functionality
- [ ] Define tour steps and flow based on current user journey

## Implementation
- [ ] Choose and install onboarding tour library (likely react-joyride)
- [ ] Create tour configuration and step definitions
- [ ] Add "first-visit" or "tour-completed" flag to user model/preferences
- [ ] Implement tour trigger logic for new users
- [ ] Create tour component with proper styling to match app theme
- [ ] Add tour controls (skip, next, previous, finish)
- [ ] Integrate tour with existing components (SpendingForm, Header, etc.)
- [ ] Handle tour state management and persistence

## User Experience & Design
- [ ] Design tour steps that highlight key features without overwhelming
- [ ] Ensure tour works on mobile and desktop responsive layouts
- [ ] Add proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Test tour flow with different user states (anonymous, authenticated)
- [ ] Implement tour restart functionality for existing users

## Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test tour functionality manually across different browsers
- [ ] Test tour with different screen sizes and orientations
- [ ] Update relevant documentation and add tour configuration notes
- [ ] Create or update rule files if new patterns emerge during development
- [ ] Ensure tour doesn't interfere with existing functionality

## Integration & Deployment
- [ ] Test tour in production-like environment
- [ ] Verify tour works with authentication flows
- [ ] Ensure tour state persists correctly across sessions
- [ ] Add tour analytics/tracking if needed
- [ ] Deploy and monitor for any issues
