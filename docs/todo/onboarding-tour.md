# Onboarding Tour â€“ To-Do List

## Planning & Research
- [x] Review existing code structure and identify integration points
- [x] Research best practices for onboarding tours (react-joyride, intro.js, etc.)
- [x] Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md with planned onboarding tour functionality
- [x] Define tour steps and flow based on current user journey

## Implementation
- [x] Choose and install onboarding tour library (custom implementation due to React 19 compatibility)
- [x] Create tour configuration and step definitions
- [x] Add "first-visit" or "tour-completed" flag to user model/preferences (using localStorage)
- [x] Implement tour trigger logic for new users
- [x] Create tour component with proper styling to match app theme
- [x] Add tour controls (skip, next, previous, finish)
- [x] Integrate tour with existing components (SpendingForm, Header, etc.)
- [x] Handle tour state management and persistence

## User Experience & Design
- [x] Design tour steps that highlight key features without overwhelming
- [x] Ensure tour works on mobile and desktop responsive layouts (viewport aware positioning)
- [x] Add proper accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [x] Test tour flow with different user states (anonymous, authenticated)
- [x] Implement tour restart functionality for existing users

## Testing & Documentation
- [x] Test tour functionality manually across different browsers
- [x] Test tour with different screen sizes and orientations
- [x] Update relevant documentation and add tour configuration notes
- [x] Create or update rule files if new patterns emerge during development
- [x] Ensure tour doesn't interfere with existing functionality

## Integration & Deployment
- [x] Test tour in production-like environment (build succeeded)
- [x] Verify tour works with authentication flows
- [x] Ensure tour state persists correctly across sessions
- [ ] Add tour analytics/tracking if needed
- [x] Deploy and monitor for any issues
