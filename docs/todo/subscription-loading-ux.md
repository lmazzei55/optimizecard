# Subscription Loading UX – To-Do List

## Planning
- [x] Review existing code and identify integration points ([`user-state.ts`](mdc:src/lib/user-state.ts), profile page)
- [x] Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md with planned changes (added note on enhanced loading states)
- [x] Analyze existing loading patterns across pages to avoid conflicts

## Implementation
- [x] Add loading indicators during fallbacks (e.g., spinner + "Loading your premium status..." message)
- [x] Reduce redundant initializations in UserState
- [x] Extend [`user-input-feedback.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/user-input-feedback.mdc) with loading patterns
- [x] Create global loading component for UserState initialization
- [x] Integrate loading states in Dashboard page (avoid conflicts with Suspense)
- [x] Integrate loading states in Pricing page (coordinate with existing loading state)
- [x] Add loading states to other pages that use UserState

## Testing & Documentation
- [x] Test functionality manually (simulate 503s)
- [x] Update relevant documentation
- [x] Create or update rule files if new patterns emerge
- [x] Test global loading across all pages
- [x] Verify no conflicts with existing page-specific loaders

## Notes
- Dashboard uses Suspense boundary for initial load
- Pricing page has its own loading state for subscription fetching
- Profile page already has the loading overlay implemented
- Need to ensure global UserState loading doesn't conflict with page-specific states
- SpendingForm has its own loading state for categories, no conflict with UserState loading
- Global loading overlay now implemented via ClientProviders in layout

## Summary
✅ Successfully implemented global UserState loading indicator that shows across all pages
✅ Removed duplicate loading overlay from profile page
✅ Coordinated with existing page-specific loading states (Pricing, Dashboard)
✅ No conflicts with existing loaders - each handles its own specific concern
