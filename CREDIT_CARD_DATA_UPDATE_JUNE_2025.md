## üßÆ **Improved Calculation Logic**

### **Problem Solved: Travel Spending Calculation**
**Before:** User enters "$1000 travel" ‚Üí gets incorrect single rate
**After:** System calculates weighted average based on typical spending patterns

**Example for Capital One Venture X:**
```
$1000 Travel Spending Breakdown:
- Flights (40%): $400 √ó 2x = $8.00
- Hotels (35%): $350 √ó 5x = $17.50  
- Car Rental (15%): $150 √ó 5x = $7.50
- Other (10%): $100 √ó 2x = $2.00
Total Monthly Value: $35.00 (vs $50 with old incorrect 5x rate)
```

### **Subcategory Priority Logic**
1. **First**: Check for specific subcategory match (Hotels (Direct), Flights (Portal), etc.)
2. **Second**: Fall back to parent category match (Travel, Dining)
3. **Third**: Use base reward rate

---

## üîÑ **Database Changes**

### **Schema Enhancements**
- Enhanced `CategoryReward` model to handle both category and subcategory rewards
- Updated `maxReward` calculations for proper spending caps
- Added support for portal vs direct booking distinctions

### **Seed Data Structure**
- All cards now use accurate June 2025 data
- Subcategories properly linked to parent categories
- Benefits updated with current annual values
- Spending caps properly configured (points vs dollars)

---

## üéØ **Impact on User Experience**

### **For Capital One Venture X Users:**
- **Before**: Incorrectly showed $600/year value for $1000 travel (5x rate)
- **After**: Correctly shows ~$420/year value (weighted average)

### **For Chase Sapphire Reserve Users:**
- **Before**: 3x on all travel

- **Benefit**: Rewards users who book directly or through Chase portal
