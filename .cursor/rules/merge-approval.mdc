- **Branch Merge Requirements**
  - Always ask for explicit user approval before merging to main
  - Present a summary of changes before requesting approval
  - Never auto-merge to main without confirmation
  - Use clear approval prompts like "Ready to merge to main? (yes/no)"

- **Pre-Merge Checklist**
  - ✅ All tests passing (if applicable)
  - ✅ Code builds successfully
  - ✅ Todo lists updated and moved to completed if done
  - ✅ PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md updated with changes
  - ✅ Any new rules documented
  - ✅ Commit messages follow conventions

- **Merge Process**
  ```bash
  # ✅ DO: Ask for approval
  echo "Ready to merge feature-branch to main?"
  echo "Summary: [brief description of changes]"
  echo "Approve merge? (yes/no)"
  
  # ❌ DON'T: Auto-merge without asking
  git checkout main && git merge feature-branch
  ```

- **Post-Merge Actions**
  - Only proceed with push after approval
  - Clean up feature branch only after successful merge
  - Confirm successful push to remote

**Why This Rule Exists:**
- Prevents accidental merges to production
- Gives user final review opportunity
- Maintains control over deployment timing
- Ensures conscious decision-making for releases
