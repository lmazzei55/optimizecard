---

- **Creation**
  - At branch kickoff, create `docs/todo/<feature-name>.md` with Markdown checkboxes
  - Use descriptive feature names that match branch names when possible
  - Include high-level tasks, not individual code changes

- **Maintenance**
  - Check boxes as tasks complete; add new items if scope grows
  - Reflect finished work in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md or relevant rule files before ticking
  - Update checklist items if requirements change during development

- **References**
  - Link the checklist in the corresponding Taskmaster task/subtask and in the PR
  - Reference the checklist in commit messages when completing items
  - Use the checklist to track progress and communicate status

- **Completion**
  - When all boxes are ticked *and* docs/rules are updated, mark the Taskmaster subtask "done"
  - Archive completed checklists by moving them to `docs/todo/completed/` directory
  - Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md with final summary of what was accomplished

- **Checklist Format**
  - Use clear, actionable task descriptions
  - Group related tasks under headings when appropriate
  - Include links to relevant files or documentation
  - Add estimated effort or complexity when helpful

- **Examples**
  ```markdown
  # Feature Name â€“ To-Do List
  
  ## Planning
  - [ ] Review existing code and identify integration points
  - [ ] Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md with planned changes
  
  ## Implementation

  - [ ] Update existing components for integration
  - [ ] Add proper TypeScript interfaces
  
  ## Testing & Documentation
