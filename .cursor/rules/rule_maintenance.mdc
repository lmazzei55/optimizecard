description: Capture effective working methods as new or updated rules
globs: .cursor/rules/**/*
alwaysApply: true

- **When to Add / Update**
  - You notice a technique or pattern that:
    - Prevents bugs or saves noticeable time, **and**
    - Has been used successfully at least twice (or once, if obviously universal)
  - Common triggers: successful debugging approach, effective refactoring pattern, useful testing strategy

- **How to Add**
  1. Create / modify a rule file in `.cursor/rules/` following the standard header format
  2. Include a short "Why it works" note and, if possible, a code diff or link to the PR that introduced it
  3. Commit the rule in the same PR (or a quick follow-up) that demonstrated the method
  4. Reference the rule in commit messages when applying the pattern

- **Rule Quality Standards**
  - **Header Format**: Always include proper YAML frontmatter with description, globs, and alwaysApply
  - **Actionable Content**: Rules should provide specific, actionable guidance
  - **Examples**: Include real code examples or references to actual implementations
  - **Scope**: Use appropriate glob patterns to target relevant files

- **Pull-Request Checklist**
  - ✅ Rule file updated OR commit message states "No new rule required"
  - ✅ Rule header's `description` is one concise sentence
  - ✅ Examples reference real code where practical
  - ✅ Glob patterns are specific and appropriate
  - ✅ Rule doesn't duplicate existing guidance

- **Continuous Improvement**
  - Outdated rules should be pruned or rewritten when discovered
  - Large refactors should review rules for relevance
  - Cross-reference related rules to avoid conflicts
  - Update rules when better patterns emerge

- **Common Rule Categories**
  - **Code Quality**: Patterns for maintainable, readable code
  - **Architecture**: Structural decisions and trade-offs
  - **Testing**: Effective testing strategies and patterns
  - **Performance**: Optimization techniques that work
  - **Security**: Security patterns and best practices
  - **Documentation**: Effective documentation approaches
