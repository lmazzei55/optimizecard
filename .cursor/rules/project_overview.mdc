  - Skim §1-4 of docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md to understand current state
  - Note any areas the change could impact (dependencies, trade-offs, user experience)
  - Consider how the change fits into the overall architecture and goals

- **When opening a PR / committing directly to main**
  - If the change adds or removes functionality, record it under §2 (Core Functionality)
  - If it fixes a bug or addresses an issue, add an entry to §3 (Recent Changes)
  - If it spawns new ideas or reveals improvement opportunities, add bullet(s) to §4 (Future Improvements)
  - If architectural decisions are made, update §5 (Architectural Notes)
  - If nothing changes, explicitly state "No Project Overview update required" in the commit/PR body

- **Update Guidelines**
  - Use present tense for current functionality
  - Use past tense with dates for completed changes
  - Be specific about what changed and why
  - Include relevant file paths and component names
  - Link to related documentation or issues when applicable

- **Quality Checks**
